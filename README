webkit-capture is yet another Linux-based command line tool to create PNG
screenshots of web pages.

It's written in python 3 so it's easier to hack and adapt than the various
C(++) implementations out there and it's based on pygobject 3 and webkitgtk
so it works on Linux and not just on Apple OSes.
